## The Summary

Glint and Grime aims to solve the problem of awarness and deep connection when it comes to sustanability and environmental issues.

Glint and Grime follows the journey of Lyra, a witch who accidentally time-traveled to a post-apocalyptic future where Earth is nearly dead due to over-pollution and the greed of our antagonist Midas, a billionaire who profits from destruction. She must defeat Midas to reverse the pollution hurting the planet. Inspired by Sky Shooter mechanics, Lyra stays at the bottom of the screen while obstacles fall from the sky. Players use a custom touchpad controller to draw magic glyphs that destroy trash obstacles, while physical buttons move Lyra left and right to dodge hazards. At the end of each level, she receives a potion that enhances her abilities, and difficulty scales up to match her growing power. As you progress through levels, watch the world transform—skies clear, trees regrow, and the sun shines again. This isn't just gameplay; it's impact visualized to motivate real-world action.

We ended up being very creative on this project with the visuals. When designing the graphics, we chose a pixel art style to maintain the post-apocalyptic feeling while bringing in the aspect of magic through color palettes and art style. The music reflects this same balance, using a combination of fantastical elements and retro chiptunes. 

## Detailed Explanation

### Substainability Problem: 
Most people don't act on environmental issues not because they don't care, but because they don't *feel* it. 

- A news article reaches ~10,000 people and is forgotten in 24 hours
- A protest reaches ~50,000 people but fades from memory
- A game? **Games reach millions and create lasting emotional connections.**

Which is what we aim to do!

### Story:
In a future ravaged by greed, **Midas**,a billionaire who profits from pollution, has turned Earth into a wasteland But **Lyra**, a witch(with a backstory unlocked as you progess through the game), refuses to accept this fate. Armed with magic intellect, she battles through falling trash, dodges hazardous waste, and literally *cleans the planet with her spells*.

As you progress through levels, watch the world transform and become cleaner with the sun shining again and trees increasing. This isn't just gameplay this is to *make users feel impact* and motivate them to contribute in the real world.

### Tools Utilized:
- Software:
  - Unity (Game and app development software)
- Art:
  - Pixilart (Pixel art web application)
  - Figma
- Music:
  - Noteflight (Sheet music composition)
  - Soundtrap (Instrumentation platform)
-API's Utilized:
LovyanGFX.hpp - Graphics library for esb32

## Challanges Faced.
The Hardware Dream We Didn't Fully Achieve: Initially, we didn't just want a game; we wanted a physical experience. Our vision was a custom touchpad controller where you'd draw spells with your finger and watch them materialize in-game. The ESP32 calibration was difficult, and detecting hand-drawn shapes in real-time without machine learning meant building geometric pattern-matching from scratch. We continued working through the night until solutions were found, though we couldn't fully implement our initial touchpad vision by the deadline.

The First-Timer's Gauntlet: None of us had used Unity before, so we learned game development from scratch during the hackathon. We encountered bugs everywhere, and since we were new to the software, we didn't store and organise the code correctly, which really slowed us down. Because we had people with different strengths and interests, deciding on a game concept proved difficult. We brainstormed multiple ideas and continuously refined them until we agreed on the best option and the differences in the strength of each team member actually helped put together an all-encompassing project.

## What's next for Glint and Grime
We want to fully realize our hardware vision by building a custom arcade-style controller with complete gesture recognition with circles for fire spells, zigzags for lightning, and more complex glyph patterns. We plan to add a deeper story that reveals Lyra's backstory and motivations as players progress, explaining how she gains potions and grows stronger to ultimately defeat Midas. We want to add more obstacle types like plastic oceans, smog clouds, e-waste mountains, and increase difficulty scaling. We're planning to integrate AI-generated environmental tips that appear between levels, teaching players real-world sustainability actions they can take. Most importantly, we want to partner with schools and environmental organizations to use Glint and Grime as an educational tool, turning education into fun while connecting it to real-world impact.
