## The Summary

Glint and Grime aims to solve the problem of awarness and deep connection when it comes to sustanability and environmental issues.

Glint and Grime follows the journey of Lyra, a witch who accidentally time-traveled to a post-apocalyptic future where Earth is nearly dead due to over-pollution and the greed of our antagonist Midas, a billionaire who profits from destruction. She must defeat Midas to reverse the pollution hurting the planet. Inspired by Sky Shooter mechanics, Lyra stays at the bottom of the screen while obstacles fall from the sky. Players use a custom touchpad controller to draw magic glyphs that destroy trash obstacles, while physical buttons move Lyra left and right to dodge hazards. At the end of each level, she receives a potion that enhances her abilities, and difficulty scales up to match her growing power. As you progress through levels, watch the world transform—skies clear, trees regrow, and the sun shines again. This isn't just gameplay; it's impact visualized to motivate real-world action.

We ended up being very creative on this project with the visuals. When designing the graphics, we chose a pixel art style to maintain the post-apocalyptic feeling while bringing in the aspect of magic through color palettes and art style. The music reflects this same balance, using a combination of fantastical elements and retro chiptunes. 

## Detailed Explanation

### Substainability Problem: 
Most people don't act on environmental issues not because they don't care, but because they don't *feel* it. 

- A news article reaches ~10,000 people and is forgotten in 24 hours
- A protest reaches ~50,000 people but fades from memory
- A game? **Games reach millions and create lasting emotional connections.**

Which is what we aim to do!

### Story:
In a future ravaged by greed, **Midas**,a billionaire who profits from pollution, has turned Earth into a wasteland But **Lyra**, a witch(with a backstory unlocked as you progess through the game), refuses to accept this fate. Armed with magic intellect, she battles through falling trash, dodges hazardous waste, and literally *cleans the planet with her spells*.

As you progress through levels, watch the world transform and become cleaner with the sun shining again and trees increasing. This isn't just gameplay this is to *make users feel impact* and motivate them to contribute in the real world.

## Challanges Faced.

We had many problems programming the entire project, as we encountered bugs everywhere. We were also struggling to calibrate the touch pad with our video game. We also struggled with designing the art and the music to fit the video game. The four of us do not have much experience when it comes to game design, and we were a little overly ambitious when designing the project and using unity for the first time. We overcame this through teamwork, helping each other when we encountered challenges and filling in for each other’s weaknesses. We also utilized any and all resources available to us in order to find solutions to our issues.
