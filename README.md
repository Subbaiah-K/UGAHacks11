**Names:** Shasyak Panda, Subbaiah Kasi, Bhaumi Nadella, and Vishaka Venkatraman

**Purpose:** 

Our game follows the journey of our main character ‘Lyra’, who accidentally time traveled to the post-apocalyptic future, a world that is nearly dead due to over-pollution and the greed of our major antagonist Midas. She must defeat the evil Midas in order to reverse all of the pollution that is hurting their planet. 

When programming this game, we were slightly inspired by the game mechanics from Sky Shooter. The witch herself has limited mobility, restricted to a space at the bottom of the screen. The obstacles fall from the sky, and it is the user’s responsibility to either dodge or use magic ‘glyphs’ to make it to the end of the level . At the end of each level, the witch receives a potion which adds to her abilities and strengthens her abilities. Each level increases in difficulty too to match the power scaling.

In terms of the hardware, we utilize a touchpad and buttons. The touchpad’s function is to allow the user to draw magic ‘glyphs’ which destroy the trash (aka our main obstacles). Our buttons control the witch’s movements (she can only move right and left). These components are hooked onto a standard bread board, but we have concepts for a controller in the making.

When designing the graphics, we chose a pixel art style as we felt that it fit with the nature of the game ( to maintain the post-apocalyptic feeling). Meanwhile the color palettes and art style bring in the aspect of magic. The music is meant to reflect the same, using a combination of fantastical elements and retro chip tunes. ALL MUSIC AND ART WERE CREATED WITHOUT AI GENERATION, BY OUR TEAM. Please do not repost or use any of our art and music.  

**Tools Utilized:**
- Hardware:
  - Two button switches
  - 6 dupoint wires
  - One esb32-2432so28 (Touchpad)
  - Micro-USB Cable
- Software:
  - Unity (Game and app development software)
  - Google Gemini 
- Art:
  - Pixilart (Pixel art web application)
- Music:
  - Noteflight (Sheet music composition)
  - Soundtrap (Instrumentation platform)

**Problems:** 

We had many problems programming the entire project, as we encountered bugs everywhere. We were also struggling to calibrate the touch pad with our video game. We also struggled with designing the art and the music to fit the video game. The four of us do not have much experience when it comes to game design, and we were a little overly ambitious when designing the project. We overcame this through teamwork, helping each other when we encountered challenges and filling in for each other’s weaknesses. We also utilized any and all resources available to us in order to find solutions to our issues.
